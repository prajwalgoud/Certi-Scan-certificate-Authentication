## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Multi-Format Support:** Verifies `.pdf`, `.png`, and `.jpg` certificate files.
* **OCR Integration:** Uses **PyTesseract** (for images) and **PyMuPDF** (for PDFs) to extract text from any document.
* **ML-Powered Verification:** Analyzes document features (keywords, dates, issuer names) using a rule-based model that simulates a Scikit-learn classifier.
* **Trusted Database:** Validates the extracted issuer name against a **SQLite** database of trusted institutions.
* **Instant Feedback:** Provides an immediate prediction ("Authentic" or "Potentially Forged") with a confidence score.
* **Secure & Private:** Uploaded files are deleted from the server immediately after processing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your system:

1.  **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  **Python 3.8+:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3.  **Tesseract-OCR:** This is a **critical** dependency.
    * **Windows:** Download and run the installer from [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
    * **macOS:** `brew install tesseract`
    * **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

    **IMPORTANT:** After installing Tesseract, you **must** update the `tesseract_cmd` path in `model.py` to match its location on your system (e.g., `r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'`).

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/CertiScan-Project.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/CertiScan-Project.git)
    cd CertiScan-Project
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername/CertiScan-Project.git` with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    (First, create the `requirements.txt` file from Step 2 below, then run:)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create and populate the database:**
    This script will create `certiscan.db` and load issuers from your JSON file.
    ```bash
    python create_db.py
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to **`http://127.0.0.1:5000`**
